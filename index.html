            <p class="lead">20.04</p><p>Life at a swiss university is better than I expected. Knowing that they charge almost no tuition fees and that swiss taxpayers are funding my education almost entirely, I do not expect many unecessary perks to be provided in the way many american universities do (do you really need a super fancy foodball field with an expensive coach when your main interest in the university is to get a quality education?). However, it turns out we have a private movie theater for students, with a large projector screen - a benefit I do not believe even the richest universities have.

Living on campus, we sometimes go explore the different buildings after a long day of studying. It turns out one of the large lecture halls (with a big projector screen) has a broken door lock. This means that even though lecture halls are normally locked for the night, we can still access it - whenever we feel like.

The screen is about 6 meters (20 feet) diagonal. The lecture hall itelf is a mere 100 meters (300 feet) from our dorms. A microwave nearby lets us prepare the popcorn to turn it into a true cinematic experience. All you need to do is plug in your computer, sit back and enjoy a movie, whenever you feel like it.

Last monday we watched the Godfather, on my friend's blue ray player. It felt like a real movie theater, which was awesome.

Although student life in european universities does not seem as amazing as the american "college dream", it can certainly be even better, as long as you get creative. After all, your experience is what you make of it, right?

Unfortunatally, it does not always go so smoothly.

Last night we wanted to watch the movie and found out that the door was FIXED (we could not open it anymore!) It was a huge dissapointment.

But then we found another lecture hall with a broken door, and we became happy again. My friend insisted on checking the other doors before giving up, and it paid off.


The best part? It's the perfect place to bring a date.</p><p></p>
            <p class="lead">19.04</p><p>This is my latest project: Take the German high school exam in Belgium. One year ago, I did not know any German. Beglium has three regions: a Dutch language region, French language region and a German language region. The German one is by far the smallest, with about 70 thousand people living there, of a total population of 11 million. A few months ago I found out that apparently they let people come over and take the final high school exam for about 40 euros, without needing to take any classes whatsoever. The only condition is to pay, and if you pass that test, you get an official belgium high school diploma, recognized by worldwide universities. The good news is that if I earn 70 % on the exam, I will receive an automatic admission to ETH in Zurich, a university I would like to attend. The problems are: I am currently in another university and need to study for my current courses The exam is in ten days. My german is still not good enough (getting there, thanks to the help of my German friends) I chose advanced mathematics even though I did not have to and it decreases my chances of success. They gave us no practice exams: Just a list of topics we need to find "on our own" All in all, it is not that bad considering the doors it can potentially open for me. In the end, it is a highschool exam, even though many of the topics are completely new to me. Even if I fail, and passed a few of the classes, I can still try again next year and pass the remaining classes, get into ETH and transer my credits to a later school year. We will see soon how successful this crazy idea ends up being. The results come out mid june. Worst comes to worst, I strengthened my general knowledge (that I did not have as I graduated from a US school) and learnt German fluently (why else would you learn German?). Los gehts.</p><p></p>
